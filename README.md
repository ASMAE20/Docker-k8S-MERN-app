# Hands-on experience with containerization and orchestration tools, as well as monitoring and logging techniques.

I worked on this project that involved containerizing a 3-tier web application developed with the MERN stack. I used Docker to create containers for the MongoDB database and the frontend and backend parts of the application. I wrote Dockerfiles for each part and followed best practices for containerization. 
I also used Docker Compose to deploy the entire application and set up a private Docker image registry.

In the second part of the project, I created Kubernetes manifests to deploy the application in a Kubernetes cluster, set up various probes, and created an Ingress to access the application. I also implemented monitoring and logging using Prometheus, Grafana, and the EFK stack.
